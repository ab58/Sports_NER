Wil Lutz kicked a 44-yard field goal with 21 seconds left , Cleveland kicker Zane Gonzalez pushed the second of his two missed field goals wide right in the final seconds , and the Saints held on for a 21 - 18 victory that extended the Browns ' winless streak to 19 games .	0,8,PLAYER;60,69,TEAM;77,90,PLAYER;181,187,TEAM;236,242,TEAM
' ' These are games that we find we find our identity a little bit , '' Brees said , alluding to New Orleans ' inability to score more than three points until the first of Michael Thomas ' two touchdown catches with 8:41 to go . ' ' These are games that , hey , you did n't have your best stuff , but you found a way . ''	72,77,PLAYER;97,108,TEAM;172,186,PLAYER

Gonzalez also missed two extra points , one week after his potential winning field goal was blocked in a season - opening tie with Pittsburgh . His final miss came from 52 yards .	0,8,PLAYER;131,141,TEAM
' ' It snowballed , '' Gonzalez said , acknowledging the psychological effect of earlier misses that he hooked left before pushing his final kick the other way . ' ' I was overcompensating . I get paid to make those kicks and I have to make them . ''	23,31,PLAYER
Gonzalez 's tough day represented only a portion of Cleveland 's implosion . Defensive back Derrick Kindred 's illegal contact penalty on what would have been a third - down sack extended New Orleans ' first touchdown drive , which ended with Thomas ' 2-yard catch and cut Cleveland 's lead to 12 - 10 .	0,8,PLAYER;52,61,TEAM;92,107,PLAYER;188,199,TEAM;243,249,PLAYER;273,282,TEAM

' ' You never want to throw late down the middle , '' Taylor said . ' ' That 's something I need to be better at . That play was not good for us . You ca n't put your team in that situation . ''	54,60,PLAYER
The turnover led to New Orleans ' second TD on a 5-yard fade to Thomas , who said he was determined to make up for his fumble earlier in the game . Thomas outjumped two defenders to make the catch .	20,31,TEAM;64,70,PLAYER;148,154,PLAYER

GOOD KAMARA	5,11,PLAYER
Alvin Kamara , the 2017 offensive rookie of the year , continued to be a bright spot in a largely frustrating day for New Orleans ' offense . His seemingly slippery running style continued to produce yards after contact and he wound up with 99 yards from scrimmage , including 53 on six catches .	0,12,PLAYER;19,23,DATETIME;118,129,TEAM
His run for a late 2-point conversion gave the Saints an 18 - 12 lead and made a difference after Taylor found rookie receiver Antonio Callaway for a 47-yard , all - or - nothing TD heave on fourth - and-5 with 1:16 to go .	47,53,TEAM;98,104,PLAYER;127,143,PLAYER
