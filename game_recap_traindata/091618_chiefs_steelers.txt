PITTSBURGH ( AP ) Tyreek Hill turned to face the cameras when the hottest quarterback in the NFL looked up , saw a potential traffic jam and urged his Kansas City Chiefs teammate to conduct his business elsewhere .	0,10,CITY;13,15,ORG;18,29,PLAYER;93,96,ORG;151,169,TEAM
' ' Do n't do that here , '' Patrick Mahomes said with a laugh .	29,44,PLAYER
Hill responded by shuffling a few steps clear of Mahomes ' stall .	0,4,PLAYER;49,56,PLAYER
Good idea . There 's little doubt who is calling the shots now in Kansas City . It 's the first - year starter with the big arm .	66,77,TEAM
Mahomes tied a franchise record with six touchdown passes and the Chiefs held off the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 42 - 37 victory Sunday that showcased why Kansas City traded away veteran Alex Smith in in the spring and put the team in the hands of a 22-year - old with all of one career start under his belt .	0,7,PLAYER;66,72,TEAM;86,105,TEAM;128,134,DATETIME;154,165,TEAM;186,196,PLAYER
' ' He had a couple good plays you know , '' coach Andy Reid said after Mahomes led Kansas City to its first win in Pittsburgh in 32 years .	51,60,BOSS;72,79,PLAYER;84,95,TEAM;116,126,TEAM
Maybe more than a couple .
Mahomes , who turns 23 on Monday , finished 23 of 28 for 326 yards . His 10 touchdown passes through two weeks are the most ever by a quarterback through two games in NFL history . Heady stuff for a player who spent almost all of last season on the bench watching Smith guide the Chiefs to a fourth playoff berth in five years .	0,7,PLAYER;26,32,DATETIME;167,170,ORG;264,269,PLAYER;280,286,TEAM
' ' You never expect to have 10 touchdowns at this point in the season , '' Mahomes said . ' ' But I knew with this offense and the weapons that we have and the scheme coach Reid has drawn up that we had a chance to be really , really good and the possibilities are endless . ''	76,83,PLAYER;174,178,BOSS
It sure looked that way while Mahomes spread the ball to seven different teammates , five of whom reached the end zone . Travis Kelce caught seven passes for 109 yards and two scores . Tyreek Hill , Chris Conley , Kareem Hunt and Demarcus Robinson also hauled in touchdown passes as the Chiefs ( 2 - 0 ) recovered in the second half after blowing an early 21-pont lead .	30,37,PLAYER;121,133,PLAYER;185,196,PLAYER;199,211,PLAYER;214,225,PLAYER;230,247,PLAYER;287,293,TEAM
' ' I see Pat doing this all season long , '' Kelce said . ' ' He 's got the confidence . As long as we give him time and get open as wide outs and tight ends and running backs , he 's going to be able to get the best out of everyone . ''	10,13,PLAYER;46,51,PLAYER
Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger shook off an achy right elbow that limited him in practice during the week , completing 39 of 60 passes for 452 yards and three touchdowns . The 36-year - old also leapt into the end zone for a 3-yard score with 1:59 to go that got the Steelers ( 0 - 1 - 1 ) within five .	0,10,TEAM;23,41,PLAYER;278,286,TEAM
Rather than attempt an onside kick , Pittsburgh sent it deep . Two runs by Hunt gave Kansas City a big first down and Steelers linebacker Tyler Matakevich was flagged for roughing the punter , allowing the Chiefs to run out the clock and put the two - time defending AFC North champions at a crossroads just two weeks into the season .	37,47,TEAM;75,79,PLAYER;85,96,TEAM;118,126,TEAM;138,154,PLAYER;206,212,TEAM;267,276,ORG
' ' It 's not fun , but it 's still early , '' Roethlisberger said . ' ' It 's kind of where are we going to go from here . It 's kind of a mirror , gut check , whatever you want to call it . We 'll see how everyone wants to respond . ''	47,61,PLAYER
