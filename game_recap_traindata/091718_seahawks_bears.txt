Mack sprinted out of the tunnel to a neat ovation prior to his first appearance at Soldier Field since a blockbuster trade from Oakland just over two weeks ago . That deal happened after he held out the entire offseason and preseason seeking a contract extension from the Raiders rather than play under the final year of his rookie contract . Chicago gave him a six - year , $ 141 million extension that guarantees $ 90 million - the richest deal ever for an NFL defensive player .	0,4,PLAYER;83,96,VENUE;128,135,TEAM;272,279,TEAM;343,350,TEAM;375,388,MONEY;415,427,MONEY;459,462,ORG
Mack also had the crowd roaring with a strip - sack in the first half , smacking the ball out of Wilson 's hand as he wound up to pass , and he consistently pressured the quarterback . It was more of the same from last week , when he had a strip - sack and interception return for a TD at Green Bay , except there was one key difference .	0,4,PLAYER;97,103,PLAYER;289,298,TEAM
