KANSAS CITY , Mo. ( AP ) Patrick Mahomes was flushed from the pocket and scrambled all the way to his left , only to realize that just about everybody wearing a Chiefs helmet was on the opposite side of the field .	0,11,CITY;14,17,STATE;20,22,ORG;25,40,PLAYER;161,167,TEAM
It was a rookie mistake by the second - year pro , one he turned into more early season magic .
Mahomes quickly reversed field against the pursuing San Francisco defense , ran all the way to the other side and threw a dart to Chris Conley in the back of the end zone . It was one of three TD passes he threw in a 38 - 27 victory over the 49ers on Sunday - and easily the most impressive .	0,7,PLAYER;52,65,TEAM;130,142,PLAYER;242,247,TEAM;251,257,DATETIME

Mahomes finished with 314 yards passing in his first regular - season start at Arrowhead Stadium , and his touchdown throws to Conley , Demetrius Harris and Sammy Watkins gave him 13 this season without an interception . That total broke the NFL record of 12 for the first three weeks of a season , set by Peyton Manning during the 2013 campaign .	0,7,PLAYER;79,96,VENUE;127,133,PLAYER;136,152,PLAYER;157,170,PLAYER;242,245,ORG;306,320,PLAYER;332,336,DATETIME
More importantly , all those touchdown tosses have the Chiefs 3 - 0 . They are the third team to score at least 38 points in each of the first three games , joining 2007 New England and the 1967 Baltimore Colts .	55,61,TEAM;165,169,DATETIME;170,181,TEAM;190,194,DATETIME;195,210,TEAM
' ' We 've got a bunch of weapons , '' said Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt , who added his first two touchdown runs this season , ' ' and Pat is just a competitor .

Jimmy Garoppolo left late in the fourth quarter after his left knee buckled during a scramble to the sideline . He was crushed on his throwing shoulder by the Chiefs ' Steven Nelson , but the damage was already done , and the 49ers ' franchise quarterback was carted off to the locker room .	0,15,PLAYER;159,165,TEAM;168,181,PLAYER;226,231,TEAM

It was still 38 - 24 when the 49ers produced a grinding , 17-play drive that wiped out more than half the fourth quarter . But it ended in a strange sequence that began with Garoppolo taking the shot from Nelson along the sideline , rather than stepping out of bounds and avoiding the hit .	30,35,TEAM;174,183,PLAYER;205,211,PLAYER
' ' I think that was his fault , '' said Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston , who was trailing the play . ' ' I pray he 's not hurt , it 's nothing serious , but as a quarterback you should step out of bounds . It 's only an inch . An inch would n't have made a difference . You got the yardage . You need to be smart . ''	41,47,TEAM;59,73,PLAYER
C.J. Beathard came in on third - and - goal and threw what appeared to be a touchdown pass to George Kittle , but it was wiped out by offensive pass interference with 5:17 left in the game .	0,13,PLAYER;94,107,PLAYER
Rather than go for it on fourth down at the Kansas City 25 , Shanahan elected to kick a field goal - keeping it a two - possession game . Then the 49ers kicked it deep rather than try an onside kick , and the Chiefs picked up a first down by penalty before Hunt churned for two more and put the game away .	44,55,TEAM;61,69,BOSS;147,152,TEAM;209,215,TEAM;257,261,PLAYER
