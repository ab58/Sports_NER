Cousins had three turnovers . He lost a fumble on a third - down sack inside Minnesota 's 20-yard line on each of the first two possessions , and Buffalo turned those recoveries into 10 points . The Bills built a 27 - 0 lead by midway through the second quarter as the crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium , where the Vikings had won 10 of their last 11 games including the playoffs , began booing with increased intensity .	0,7,PLAYER;77,86,TEAM;146,153,TEAM;199,204,TEAM;278,295,VENUE;308,315,TEAM
