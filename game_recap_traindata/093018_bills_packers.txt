GREEN BAY , Wis. ( AP ) This is more like it for the Green Bay Packers .	0,9,CITY;12,16,STATE;53,70,TEAM

And just the edge that the Packers ( 2 - 1 - 1 ) needed with Rodgers not necessarily playing at his best . He was 22 of 40 for 298 yards with one touchdown . Green Bay had decisive edges in total offense ( 423 - 145 ) and first downs ( 22 - 11 ) .	27,34,TEAM;61,68,PLAYER;158,167,TEAM

Buffalo did manage to force Rodgers to throw his first interception of the year .	0,7,TEAM;28,35,PLAYER
But a 16 - 0 lead at the half was more than enough cushion against Buffalo 's feeble offense . Even the return of running back LeSean McCoy , who missed a game because of a rib injury , did n't help the Bills ( 1 - 3 ) .	67,74,TEAM;127,139,PLAYER;203,208,TEAM
' ' We were out of rhythm on offense . We needed to find some consistency , '' Bills coach Sean McDermott said .	79,84,TEAM;91,105,BOSS

ANOTHER AARON	8,13,PLAYER
Aaron Jones added 65 yards and a score on 11 carries for the Packers , who slowed in the second half after a fast start on offense .
