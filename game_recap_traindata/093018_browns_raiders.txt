McCrane missed a 50-yard field goal on the opening possession of overtime in his NFL debut and a 47-yarder earlier in the game before getting another chance when Carr drove the Raiders ( 1 - 3 ) back down the field again after a defensive stop for the game winner with 1:46 left in the period .0,7,PLAYER;81,84,ORG;162,166,PLAYER;177,184,TEAM

The field goal dealt the Browns ( 1 - 2 - 1 ) another tough loss as they blew a 14-point lead in the second half and then allowed to get the game - tying TD and 2-point conversion in the final seconds of regulation to spoil Baker Mayfield 's NFL starting debut .	25,31,TEAM;224,238,PLAYER;242,245,ORG

The Browns broke out to a 28 - 14 lead midway through the third quarter only to fall behind 34 - 28 early in the fourth thanks in part to Mayfield losing two fumbles deep in his own territory to set up TD passes by Carr .	4,10,TEAM;138,146,PLAYER;215,219,PLAYER
But the Raiders squandered a fourth - quarter lead for the second straight week , falling behind 42 - 34 after Mayfield 's 59-yard pass to Antonio Callaway set up Carlos Hyde 's 1-yard run and rookie Nick Chubb ran 41 yards for his second long TD of the game .	8,15,TEAM;111,119,PLAYER;139,155,PLAYER;163,174,PLAYER;200,210,PLAYER
It looked as if that would decide the game when the Browns forced Carr into two incompletions from the 9 with under two minutes left to lead to a turnover on downs .	52,58,TEAM;66,70,PLAYER
Cleveland appeared to be in position to run out the clock when Hyde converted a first down , but a replay review determined he was down just short of the marker and the Browns punted .	0,9,TEAM;63,67,PLAYER;169,175,TEAM
' ' That was huge , '' Hyde said . ' ' That was a chance to put the game away right there . Definitely . That was a game - changer right there . ''	23,27,PLAYER
Carr then engineered a 53-yard touchdown drive capped by a 7-yard pass to Jared Cook with 30 seconds to play . The Raiders still needed the 2-point conversion to tie it and they got it when Jordy Nelson came down with a fade despite physical coverage by ex - Raider TJ Carrie .	0,4,PLAYER;74,84,PLAYER;115,122,TEAM;190,202,PLAYER;259,265,TEAM;266,275,PLAYER

QUICK WHISTLE
The Raiders were upset by a quick whistle that possibly cost Lynch a long TD run . Lynch ran left and linebacker Joe Schobert tried to tackle him but Lynch appeared to spin out of it without going to the ground .
