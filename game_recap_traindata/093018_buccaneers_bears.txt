The Bears ( 3 - 1 ) won their third straight with Trubisky delivering the sort of performance general manager Ryan Pace envisioned when he traded up a spot to draft the prized quarterback with the No . 2 overall pick last year .	4,9,TEAM;50,58,PLAYER;110,119,PLAYER
He finished one TD pass short of the franchise mark set by Sid Luckman against the New York Giants in 1943 . Luckman is tied with seven others in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game .

Khalil Mack had a strip - sack in the first half against Fitzpatrick . That made him the first player with a sack and forced fumble in four straight games since Robert Mathis for Indianapolis in 2005 .
