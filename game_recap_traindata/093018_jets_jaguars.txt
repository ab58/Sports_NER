JACKSONVILLE , Fla. ( AP ) Blake Bortles felt as though Jacksonville 's offense wasted a dominant defensive performance last week .	0,12,CITY;15,19,STATE;22,24,ORG;27,40,PLAYER;56,68,TEAM
He refused to let it happen again .
Bortles threw two touchdown passes , including a 67-yarder to Donte Moncrief , and the Jaguars offense gave the defense plenty of help in a 31 - 12 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday . Bortles ended up with a career - high 388 yards passing , topping 375 yards for the second time in three games .	0,7,PLAYER;62,76,PLAYER;87,94,TEAM;165,178,TEAM;182,188,DATETIME;191,198,PLAYER
' ' ( The defense ) played incredible again today , '' Bortles said . ' ' There were some sloppy parts of the game that we ' ve got to clean up , but to give them some points to go play with the lead was good . ''	55,62,PLAYER
It was a much different story a week ago , when the Jaguars ( 3 - 1 ) managed just two field goals in a 9 - 6 loss to Tennessee .	52,59,TEAM;118,127,TEAM
Bortles was clearly off in that one . He was much sharper against the Jets ( 1 - 3 ) , who have dropped three straight .	0,7,PLAYER;70,74,TEAM
He found T.J. Yeldon wide open for a 31-yard score in the second quarter and then beat a blitz with the deep pass to Moncrief down the sideline .	9,20,PLAYER;117,125,PLAYER
The pass to Moncrief was Jacksonville 's lone offensive highlight in an ugly second half . The Jaguars had three turnovers that led to nine points for the Jets .	12,20,PLAYER;25,37,TEAM;95,102,TEAM;155,159,TEAM
' ' It 's just growth . That 's the easiest way to say it , '' Jaguars defensive tackle Malik Jackson said . ' ' We ' ve got to be consistent like this all time . Offense dropped the ball last week , so to speak , but this week they picked it up and put 500 yards on the board .	63,70,TEAM;88,101,PLAYER
' ' That 's the best measure of a man and a football player - to put that turmoil behind you and move on and show your growth , and we did that . ''
Jets rookie Sam Darnold was harassed early and often , getting sacked three times and nearly throwing three interceptions . Tashaun Gipson 's pick was overturned by a holding penalty on the other side of the field , and Pro Bowl cornerbacks A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey each dropped INTs that would have ended New York 's first two scoring drives .	0,4,TEAM;12,23,PLAYER;124,138,PLAYER;220,228,GAME;241,251,PLAYER;256,268,PLAYER;309,317,TEAM
Regardless , the Jaguars allowed 178 yards , allowed 10 first downs and recorded its first safety since 2014 . It was the team 's best defensive output since holding Cincinnati to 148 yards last November .	17,24,TEAM;104,108,DATETIME;166,176,TEAM;195,203,DATETIME
The Jets scored their lone touchdown following Yeldon 's fourth - quarter fumble , a 2-yard pass from Darnold to Jordan Leggett . It was hardly the " identity game " the Jets had wanted .	4,8,TEAM;47,53,PLAYER;113,127,PLAYER;170,174,TEAM
' ' I felt we took a step back today , '' Jets coach Todd Bowles said . ' ' Nobody played well . We gave up a bunch of yards . We usually fight to be in ballgames . We 're usually in every ballgame . But we shot ourselves in the foot too much in the first half today . It 's back to the drawing board in every phase - offense , defense , special teams . It 's back to the drawing board .	42,46,TEAM;53,64,BOSS
' ' The other three games , we lost on silly things but we were in ballgames . Today , I do n't think we were in the ballgame . We did n't give ourselves a chance . ''
It was about what the confident Jaguars expected . They improved to 6 - 1 following losses in coach Doug Marrone 's two seasons .	32,39,TEAM;100,112,BOSS
Jacksonville 's biggest concern coming out of the victory was the health of running back Leonard Fournette , who re - injured his strained right hamstring . Fournette missed the last two games while trying to get back to full speed , but tweaked it during his return .	0,12,TEAM;89,106,PLAYER;157,166,PLAYER
Fournette ran 11 times for 30 yards before leaving the game for good . Marrone said he 's worried about the relapse .	0,9,PLAYER;71,78,BOSS
' ' I 'd be ( lying ) if I said no , '' Marrone said . ` Anytime you come back and you 're ready to go and then all of a sudden you get injured again , it 's not a good sign . ''	40,47,BOSS
