The third - year kicker missed a 59-yarder to win the game at the end of regulation , then a 37-yarder near the end of overtime .

' ' It was a rollercoaster . I was just trying to steady , '' Fairbairn said . ' ' That 's exactly what we needed . ''	62,71,PLAYER
Nothing went according to the script .
Just moments earlier , Adam Vinatieri , the NFL 's new career field goals leader , thought he might get to it .	23,37,PLAYER;44,47,ORG
But after Andrew Luck bounced a short pass to Chester Rogers on fourth - and-4 from his own 43-yard line , Deshaun Watson got the ball back with 24 seconds left and no timeouts and found DeAndre Hopkins for a 24-yard completion to get Fairbairn into position .	10,21,PLAYER;46,60,PLAYER;107,121,PLAYER;187,202,PLAYER;235,244,PLAYER
His first try sailed wide as the crowd roared . But coach Frank Reich called timeout in an effort to ice Fairbairn , who made the second one .	58,69,BOSS;105,114,PLAYER
The bigger question , though , was about Reich 's decision to go for it rather than punt and settle for a tie .	41,46,BOSS
' ' We 're not playing to tie , '' Reich said . ' ' We 're going for that 10 times out of 10 . That ( play ) has just got to work . ''	35,40,BOSS
When it did n't , the Texans ' nine - game losing streak was over with their first win since Nov. 19 .	22,38,TEAM;93,100,DATETIME
The most promising news for Houston ( 1 - 3 ) , though , was that Watson & Co. appeared to be in sync .	28,35,TEAM;66,72,PLAYER

' ' It was very unconventional , but we 'll take it , '' J.J. Watt said after recording two more sacks and becoming the second - fastest in league history to 80 .	57,66,PLAYER
It 's the third time in four weeks Indy ( 1 - 3 ) has fallen short in the closing minutes , this one spoiling Vinatieri 's milestone day .	35,39,TEAM;110,119,PLAYER
The 45-year - old kicker became the league 's career leader in field goals when he made a 42-yarder with 2 seconds left in the first half . He extended the mark to 567 with a 44-yarder that gave Indy a 34 - 31 lead with 6 minutes left in overtime .	195,199,TEAM

But Fairbairn tied the score with a 29-yard kick and won it with the 37-yarder .	4,13,PLAYER
Luck was 40 of 62 for a career - high 464 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions but lamented his last throw .	0,4,PLAYER
' ' I did not get the ball to Chester to make the play and I ' m sick about it , '' he said .	30,37,PLAYER
Still , Luck gave Indy a chance after trailing 28 - 7 midway through the third quarter .	8,12,PLAYER;18,22,TEAM
He threw a 14-yard TD pass to Nyheim Hines , a 5-yard TD pass to Eric Ebron and a 9-yard TD pass to Hines before tying the score at 31 with a 2-point conversion pass to Rogers with 45 seconds to go in regulation .	30,42,PLAYER;65,75,PLAYER;100,105,PLAYER;169,175,PLAYER

' ' Any time you win a game , no matter how you win it , it 's great , '' Hopkins said . ' ' We knew what we were up against . We had to go out and finish it . ''	74,81,PLAYER
