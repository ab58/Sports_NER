EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. ( AP ) Isaiah Crowell ran all over the Denver Broncos ' suddenly leaky defense - and kept his touchdown celebration low - key this time around .	0,15,CITY;18,22,STATE;25,27,ORG;30,44,PLAYER;62,76,TEAM
The New York running back ran for a franchise - record 219 yards , including a 77-yard touchdown , and Sam Darnold threw two TD passes to Robby Anderson , including a 76-yarder , to help the big - play Jets snap a three - game losing streak with a 34 - 16 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday .	4,12,TEAM;103,114,PLAYER;138,152,PLAYER;202,206,TEAM;273,287,TEAM;291,297,DATETIME
' ' It means a lot to me , '' Crowell said . ' ' I ' ve got to give all the credit to my O - line . I ca n't really take the credit . Really , it was all them . I mean , the holes were open . Anybody could ' ve run through them . It just happened to be me .	30,37,PLAYER
' ' They really set the record . ''
Crowell needed just 15 carries to break the team record of 210 yards rushing set by Thomas Jones in 2009 against Buffalo . His 14.6 yards per carry set an NFL record for a player with at least 15 attempts , according to Elias Sports Bureau .	0,7,PLAYER;84,96,PLAYER;100,104,DATETIME;113,120,TEAM;220,239,ORG
Bilal Powell added 99 yards rushing , and New York finished with 323 yards on the ground - second - most in team history - and 512 overall yards .	0,12,PLAYER;42,50,TEAM
After an ugly 20-yard punt early in the second quarter by Colby Wadman , who replaced the injured Marquette King , the Jets ( 2 - 3 ) took advantage immediately . Crowell took the handoff , scooted to the left sideline and zipped into the end zone - getting some nice blocks from receivers Anderson , Pryor and Jermaine Kearse along the way - for a 77-yard yard touchdown that tied the game .	58,70,PLAYER;98,112,PLAYER;119,123,TEAM;163,170,PLAYER;290,298,PLAYER;301,306,PLAYER;311,326,PLAYER
Crowell was fined $ 13,369 by the NFL and given a stern lecture from coach Todd Bowles for his crude TD celebration two weeks ago in Cleveland when he wiped his rear end with the football . This time , Crowell simply tossed the ball to the turf in the end zone .	0,7,PLAYER;18,26,MONEY;34,37,ORG;75,86,BOSS;133,142,TEAM;202,209,PLAYER

The Jets ' defense came up big , too , while playing without coordinator Kacy Rodgers , who is dealing with what Bowles has called a ' ' serious '' illness . Bowles ran the defense against the Broncos and the Jets kept the pressure on Keenum all game , sacking him four times - including two by Leonard Williams .	4,8,TEAM;73,85,BOSS;113,119,BOSS;158,164,BOSS;193,200,TEAM;209,213,TEAM;235,241,PLAYER;295,311,PLAYER
