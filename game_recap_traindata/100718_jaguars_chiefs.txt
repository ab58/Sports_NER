Chiefs get pick-6 , march all over Jags in soggy 30 - 14 romp	0,6,PLAYER;35,39,TEAM
KANSAS CITY , Mo. ( AP ) Patrick Mahomes had finally thrown an interception , the first all season for the Chiefs ' talented young quarterback , and the Jacksonville offense had shuffled back onto the field .	0,11,CITY;14,17,STATE;20,22,ORG;25,40,PLAYER;107,113,TEAM;153,165,TEAM
The Chiefs immediately strip - sacked Blake Bortles to take the ball right back .	4,10,TEAM;38,51,PLAYER
Their beleaguered defense also picked off Bortles four times and sacked him five , and Chris Jones took one of those interceptions back for a touchdown , proving during a 30 - 14 romp over Jacksonville on a soggy Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium that the Chiefs are more than just an offensive dynamo .	42,49,PLAYER;87,98,PLAYER;189,201,TEAM;213,219,DATETIME;223,240,VENUE;250,256,TEAM
' ' It shows what kind of team we are , '' said Mahomes , who finished with 313 yards passing and ran for a touchdown . ' ' I ' m just excited to come out with a win on a day the defense made plays . ''	48,55,PLAYER
Oh , the league 's highest - scoring offense still made plays .
Kareem Hunt ran for 87 yards and a touchdown , and Travis Kelce hauled in five catches for 100 yards , helping the Chiefs ( 5 - 0 ) move the ball at will against the NFL 's top - rated defense .	0,11,PLAYER;51,63,PLAYER;115,121,TEAM;166,169,ORG
Tyreek Hill , who was frequently matched up with the Jaguars ' Jalen Ramsey in an entertaining one - on - one affair , added four catches for 61 yards as the Chiefs rolled up 424 yards total .	0,11,PLAYER;53,60,TEAM;63,75,PLAYER;158,164,TEAM
' ' That play calling was something I ' ve never seen before , '' said the Jaguars ' Tashaun Gipson , who picked off Mahomes before leaving with a groin injury . ' ' Tip your hat to them . Obviously , the offensive personnel they ' ve got - they came out here and they beat us . ''	75,82,TEAM;85,99,PLAYER;117,124,PLAYER
The game eventually grew into a testy affair , resulting in a pair of ejections .
Jones was booted in the second half after he dropped an elbow on a Jaguars lineman while both were on the ground following a point - after attempt . Then , pass rusher Dee Ford joined him in the locker room when he was whistled for his second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty .	0,5,PLAYER;67,74,TEAM;168,176,PLAYER
' ' You ca n't let emotions get the best of you , '' Chiefs coach Andy Reid said .	53,59,TEAM;66,75,BOSS
If anybody had reason to get frustrated it was Bortles , who was 33 of 61 for 430 yards with a touchdown and those four interceptions . Most of his yardage came in garbage time , and while he ran for a touchdown , he also was strip - sacked during Jacksonville 's miserable first half .	47,54,PLAYER;248,260,TEAM
Mahomes led the Chiefs 73 yards on their first possession , finishing the drive himself with a short scramble for a touchdown . Then he led the league 's high - powered offense 82 yards for a field goal a few minutes later , leaving Jacksonville 's vaunted D second - guessing itself .	0,7,PLAYER;16,22,TEAM;233,245,TEAM
Meanwhile , the Jaguars ' offense was having all kinds of problems .	16,23,TEAM
Jacksonville ( 3 - 2 ) drove inside the Kansas City 5 early in the second quarter , but an incomplete fade on third down and another incompletion on fourth turned the ball over . Bortles was stripped on the first play of their next possession , and he threw the pick-6 to Jones on the first play of the next .	0,12,TEAM;40,51,TEAM;179,186,PLAYER;272,277,PLAYER
The calamitous half ended when Bortles , trying to force a pass into the end zone , instead bounced it off his offensive lineman 's helmet and right to Steven Nelson for another interception .	31,38,PLAYER;152,165,PLAYER
' ' It felt a lot like some games we ' ve had in the past , just moved the ball , there were some good things done , we had some bad turnovers , '' Bortles said . ' ' You ca n't turn the ball over . ''	148,155,PLAYER
In Bortles ' defense , his offensive line did n't give him a whole lot of time . Along with the five sacks , the Chiefs were credited with 11 hurries , spending most of the game in his face .	3,10,PLAYER;113,119,TEAM
Bortles ' only real highlight came late in the game , when he escaped the collapsing pocket and angled toward the sideline , then lowered his shoulder to finish off a 21-yard touchdown run .	0,7,PLAYER
The Jaguars recovered the onside kick , only for the Chiefs to force another turnover on downs .	4,11,TEAM;53,59,TEAM
' ' They did a good job early in the game getting a lead . They did a good job early on third downs in the game . Offensively , we did n't execute , '' Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said . ' ' Again , we had a poor showing in the red zone , we had turnovers , and the game got out of hand . Got to play better . We ' ve got to coach better , play better . We got to go back and get this team back on track . ''	152,159,TEAM;166,178,BOSS
