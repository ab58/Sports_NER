SEATTLE ( AP ) Andrew Whitworth was sitting on the bench with his helmet on the ground . Jared Goff was busy in conversation with referee Clete Blakeman about a previous play . Initially , the Los Angeles Rams believed coach Sean McVay would take the safe play and punt rather than the risk of going for it on fourth down with less than 2 minutes remaining inside Rams territory .	0,7,CITY;10,12,ORG;15,31,PLAYER;89,99,PLAYER;138,152,BOSS;193,209,TEAM;225,235,BOSS;364,368,TEAM
That 's not the style of McVay , or these still unbeaten Rams .	25,30,BOSS;57,61,TEAM
' ' We knew we were going to get it , '' running back Todd Gurley said .	54,65,PLAYER
Rather than give the ball back to Russell Wilson , McVay believed in his offense to pick up less than a yard . And when Jared Goff plowed forward to convert the fourth - and-1 with 1:39 left , the Rams celebrated a 33 - 31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks that kept Los Angeles perfect at 5 - 0 .	34,48,PLAYER;51,56,BOSS;120,130,PLAYER;197,201,TEAM;240,256,TEAM;267,278,TEAM
Gurley carried the load , rushing for three touchdowns , and Goff passed for one score and threw for 321 yards despite losing two of his top receivers to concussions in the first half .
