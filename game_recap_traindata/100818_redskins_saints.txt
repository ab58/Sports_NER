And so I ' m still very focused on that , '' Brees said . ' ' And yet , when something like this happens , there are so many people who are responsible for that , that are a part of that , that makes me happy .

MAKING MEMORIES
When Saints began one of their last first - half possessions on their own 38 , Brees needed just 35 yards to break the record . On the first play of the drive , Brees launched a pass toward the right sideline to the speedy Smith , who was wide open and easily sprinted away from Nicholson 's tackle attempt en route to the end zone .	5,11,TEAM;79,84,PLAYER;161,166,PLAYER;223,228,PLAYER;279,288,PLAYER
' ' I knew we were within striking distance '' of the record , Brees said . ' ' I did n't know it was going to happen on the first play to Tre'Quan . But I do n't think it could have happened in any better fashion than it did . To have then that moment with my teammates on the field , the offensive line , it played out even greater than I ever could have imagined . ''	63,68,PLAYER;139,147,PLAYER
Brees ' teammates ran toward their quarterback as he jogged behind the play , and a group of them formed a jumping , celebrating mass of black and gold next to the Saints ' fleur - de - lis emblem on the 50-yard line .	0,5,PLAYER;164,170,TEAM

He finished with 53 yards rushing and 20 receiving .

PAINFUL PENALTIES
