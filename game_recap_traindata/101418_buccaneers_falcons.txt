Especially on the final play .
Winston and the Bucs drove to the Atlanta 21 but were out of timeouts . With the Falcons dropping nearly everyone toward the end zone , expecting a pass , Winston took the snap and darted straight up the middle of the field . When he was about to be tackled at the 10 , he pitched the ball toward receiver Adam Humphries , who was so intent on going for the winning score he could n't hang on .	0,7,PLAYER;16,20,TEAM;34,41,TEAM;81,88,TEAM;155,162,PLAYER;306,320,PLAYER

Jackson might 've had a chance to dive for the end zone , but he could n't come up with another bouncing ball . It rolled harmlessly out of bounds to end the game .	20,30,PLAYER;74,88,PLAYER;119,126,PLAYER

Winston , who was suspended for the first three games of the season and came off the bench in Week 4 , threw for 395 yards and four TDs . His performance , though , was marred by a pair of interceptions , one a deep ball that was picked off at the Atlanta 1 and a deflected pass in the end zone that ricocheted high in the air and was grabbed by Brian Poole to deny a red - zone scoring chance .	0,7,PLAYER;94,100,DATETIME;248,255,TEAM;346,357,PLAYER
Ryan 's three TD passes gave him 274 in his career , passing Joe Montana for 16th on the career list .	0,4,PLAYER;61,72,PLAYER
' ' Obviously it 's very special any time your name is brought up with Joe 's , '' Ryan said . ' ' But I 'm more excited about the win . ''	71,74,PLAYER;83,87,PLAYER

Bryant 's kick just cleared the crossbar , extending the Falcons ' lead . The 43-yard - old Bryant put everything into the kick and immediately grabbed his right hamstring before hobbling off the field .	0,6,PLAYER;57,64,TEAM;92,98,PLAYER
