' ' I do n't want to sit here and say that we cracked the code , because they have been vulnerable to the run game , so we have to be honest about that on all levels , '' Murray said . ' ' But I will say I feel we 're capable of running the ball that way , no matter who we 're playing . ''	171,177,PLAYER

Even Kirk Cousins joined the fun for the Vikings ( 3 - 2 - 1 ) with an option - style run across the goal line in the third quarter , before throwing to Adam Thielen for a score on the following possession . The Vikings celebrated their touchdowns with a choreographed a clumsy " dead - arm " dance that Thielen recalled from college .	5,17,PLAYER;41,48,TEAM;153,165,PLAYER;212,219,TEAM;280,290,DANCE;304,311,PLAYER

Cousins still managed to complete 24 of 34 attempts for 233 yards , thanks mostly to Thielen and his exceptional ability to get open anywhere on the field and turn off - target throws into clutch catches . He made a toe - dragging sideline grab on third - and-13 right at the first - down marker to extend the opening possession of the third quarter , before capping the drive in the end zone with a 13-yard reception on a seam route after leaving linebacker Josh Bynes in his wake with a stutter step .	0,7,PLAYER;85,92,PLAYER;459,469,PLAYER
The tone was set in the first quarter on Murray 's 21-yard touchdown run , when he flattened Antoine Bethea with a stiff arm .	41,47,PLAYER;93,107,PLAYER
